Level 1: The Foundations (Curriculum)
Duration: 4–6 Weeks Objective: Build a professional-grade static website from scratch.

The Box Model: Understanding padding vs. margin vs. border.

Modern Layouts: Flexbox (for 1D layouts) and Grid (for 2D layouts). Forget "float".

⚔️ Mission: Week 1 Schedule
Theme: "Hello World" to "Styled Page" Focus: HTML Structure & Basic CSS.

Monday: The Awakening
The Lab (1h): Watch SuperSimpleDev "HTML & CSS Full Course" (0:00 to ~0:45 mins). Focus on Buttons and Text.

The Grind (1h): Open VS Code. Don't just watch—type out every single line of code he writes. Change the text to your own name. Change the buttons to say "Attack" and "Defend".

The Quest (1h): Create a file called me.html. Write a paragraph about yourself using <p>, a bold sentence using <b> or <strong>, and a link to Google using <a>.

Tuesday: The Stylist
The Lab (1h): Watch SuperSimpleDev (Finish the "CSS Basics" and "Hovers/Transitions" sections).

The Grind (1h): Take your me.html. Turn the background black and the text green (Hacker style). Make a button that slowly changes color when you hover over it.

The Quest (1h): Mini-Project: The Wanted Poster. Build a simple webpage that looks like a wanted poster. It needs an image (<img>), a big header (<h1>), and a reward amount.

Wednesday: The Architect (The Box Model)
The Lab (1h): Watch SuperSimpleDev (Section on "Chrome DevTools & CSS Box Model"). This is crucial.

The Grind (1h): Right-click random websites (like YouTube or Twitter), click "Inspect," and delete elements to see what happens. Change headlines to say silly things.

The Quest (1h): Fix your "Wanted Poster." Add padding inside the border so the text isn't squished. Add margin outside so it's centered on the screen.

Thursday: The Gamer (CSS Logic)
The Lab (1h): Watch a shorter video on "CSS Classes vs Ids".

The Grind (1h): Play Time. Go to CSS Diner and beat the first 15 levels. It teaches you how to select specific elements.

The Quest (1h): Create menu.html. Make a restaurant menu. Use a class .spicy to make specific items red and bold. Use a class .cheap to make cheap items green.

Friday: The Layout (Flexbox Intro)
The Lab (1h): Watch SuperSimpleDev (Section on "Flexbox"). Warning: This might be confusing at first. That is normal.

The Grind (1h): Play Time. Go to Flexbox Froggy. Beat all 24 levels. Do not skip this.

The Quest (1h): Create a "Navigation Bar". Put a Logo on the left and links (Home, About, Contact) on the right using display: flex; and justify-content: space-between;.

Saturday: The Review (Boss Battle Prep)
The Lab (1h): Rewatch any part of the Box Model or Flexbox video you felt shaky on.

The Grind (1h): Play Time. Play Flexbox Defense. It's a tower defense game where you position towers using CSS.

The Quest (1h): Project Setup. Create a folder for your Boss Battle: "Retro-Portfolio". Create index.html, style.css, and an images folder. Connect them and test that it works.

Sunday: REST DAY
ADHD Rule: Do NOT code. Let your brain defragment. If you absolutely must, watch a "Day in the Life of a Software Engineer" video for motivation, but no tutorials.
